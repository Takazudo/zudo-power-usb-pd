title: v3 USB-PD Failure Diagnosis (pin 18 root cause)
sidebar_position: 10
---

Why the v3 board still fails to negotiate USB-PD even after (a) the STUSB4500 NVM was
correctly reprogrammed (`SNK_PDO_NUMB=2`, 15 V/3 A) and (b) pin 18 was bodged.

<Note title="Superseded by the v4 diagnosis / 2-board split — the open question below is resolved">

v3 was superseded by v4, which itself later also failed USB-PD negotiation for
different reasons and triggered the current Board A / Board B split — see
[v4 USB-PD Failure Diagnosis](./v4-pd-failure-diagnosis.md) and
[Board Split Decision](./board-split-decision.md). The "Open question for you"
at the end of this page (R14's far end: VBUS_IN or VBUS_OUT?) has since been
answered and locked into the Board A spec: **R14 connects to `VBUS_IN`**
(receptacle-side, pre-load-switch), unchanged from the v3 fix — see
[Board A: USB-PD Core](../overview/board-a-usb-pd-core.md#net-connectivity-table-fixed-circuit),
`VBUS_VS_DISCH` row.

**Method:** every claim below was verified by reading the actual net topology in
`usb-pd-input.kicad_sch` against U1's own symbol pin table (symbol origin `176.53,63.5`,
**not mirrored**; absolute pin = `176.53+dx, 63.5−dy`). A first multi-agent pass produced
several **false** findings from guessing pin numbers by screen position; those are listed in
"Ruled out" so nobody chases them.

## ROOT CAUSE (blocker): pin 18 VBUS_VS_DISCH tied to GND

Verified net of pin 18 = `{ U1.18, the VBUS_VS_DISCH label, R14.1, TP6 }`, and **R14's other
end goes to a GND symbol** (`#PWR046` at 236.22,76.2). The net **never touches VBUS anywhere**
(confirmed: no VBUS_IN / VBUS_OUT node on it).

```
pin18 ──┬── VBUS_VS_DISCH label ── TP6
        └── R14 (470 Ω) ── GND        ← WRONG: should reach VBUS, not GND
```

**Why this kills negotiation:** VBUS_VS_DISCH is the high-voltage analog input the STUSB4500
uses to confirm VBUS is in a valid window before it asserts VBUS_EN_SNK (the load-switch
enable). Held at 0 V, the chip believes VBUS is permanently absent → never enables the sink
path → no contract. This is why "NVM correct + pin 18 bodged, still dead": the bodge restored
a *connection*, but to **GND**, so the sense input is still grounded. Even a perfect respin of
the current schematic would still fail.

> **Datasheet note (why GND looked plausible):** ST DS12499 calls pin 18 VBUS_VS_**DISCH** —
> it doubles as a VBUS discharge path (≤50 mA, hence a series R). That dual name is what led
> the original design (and our earlier docs) to tie it toward GND. But its **primary** job is
> VBUS *voltage sensing*, so the pin-18 network's far end must reach the **VBUS rail**, not
> ground. The v1-debug doc said exactly this ("pin 18 → 470 Ω → VBUS_IN").

### The fix (schematic)

Pin 18 needs to see VBUS through a series/divider, not a pull to GND. Two options:

- **Simplest (matches v1-debug intent):** make R14 the series element to VBUS:
  `VBUS_IN → R14 (470 Ω) → pin 18`. Delete the R14→GND wire + `#PWR046`.
- **Safer divider (recommended):** `VBUS_IN → R_top (≈470 kΩ) → pin 18 → R14 (470 Ω) → GND`,
  so the pin sees a small, current-limited fraction of VBUS. Keep TP6 on the pin-18 node.

Confirm the exact recommended topology/value against the ST datasheet Fig. 10 and the SparkFun
Power Delivery Board before committing — see the open question below.

### Fastest bench bodge to PROVE it (minutes, before any respin)

1. Lift R14's GND end (or remove R14).
2. Wire **VBUS_IN** (Q1 source / J1 VBUS / a VBUS test point) **→ ~470 kΩ → pin 18 (or TP6)**,
   and refit R14 (470 Ω) from pin 18 → GND. Net: `VBUS_IN → 470k → pin18 → 470Ω → GND`.
3. Re-plug USB-C. **DMM TP6:** was ~0 V (broken) → now non-zero, rising with VBUS (pass).
   Watch VBEN (pin 16) assert and the +12/+5/−12 rails come up.

If that single bodge brings PD up, pin 18 was the whole story.

## Secondary items — all verified OK (no action)

- **VSYS (pin 22):** hard-tied to GND (#PWR047) — correct for a VBUS-powered (non-battery)
  design. (Earlier audit's "floating, missing decap" was wrong.)
- **VREG_2V7 (pin 23):** decoupled by **C30 (1 µF)**. OK. Bench: ≈ 2.7 V when powered.
- **VREG_1V2 (pin 21):** decoupled by **C34 (1 µF)**. OK. Bench: ≈ 1.2 V when powered.
- **DISCH (pin 9):** confirm intended connection per datasheet (minor, not a blocker).

**Conclusion: pin 18 → GND is the _only_ confirmed bug. The rest of the front end is correct.**

## Ruled out — do NOT chase (false findings from position-guessing)

- **"VDD (pin 24) shorted to GND"** — FALSE. Pin 24 carries the `VDD` global label. The GND
  the agent saw was on **pin 13 ADDR1**, a correct address strap.
- **"ADDR0→CC1DB / ADDR1→VDD mis-wired"** — FALSE. Both ADDR pins go to GND (addr 0x28).
- **"RESET tied to GND is wrong"** — FALSE. RESET is active-HIGH (DS12499 §2.2.3); held low = deasserted = normal run.
- **"SCL shorted to RESET/GND"** — FALSE. SCL/SDA route correctly to their labels + pull-ups.
- **"Pin 10 GND / pins floating"** — FALSE. Every U1 pin has a wire; pin 10 reaches GND.
- **Q1 load switch** — schematic OK (source→VBUS_IN, drain→VBUS_OUT, gate via VBEN). Worth a
  PCB continuity spot-check but not the blocker.

## Open question for you

R14's far end should go to **VBUS** — but VBUS_IN or VBUS_OUT? VBUS_IN = raw USB-C VBUS
(present before the load switch); VBUS_OUT = after Q1. For *sink* VBUS validity sensing you
generally want the **receptacle-side VBUS (VBUS_IN)**, which is also what the v1-debug doc
specified. Recommend VBUS_IN unless the datasheet Fig. 10 says otherwise. Want me to fetch the
datasheet figure and the SparkFun reference to lock down the exact value + which VBUS node, and
then apply the schematic edit for you?
