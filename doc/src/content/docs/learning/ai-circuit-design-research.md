title: "AI-Assisted Circuit Design: Workflows for the Idea → KiCad Schematic Handoff"
sidebar_position: 19
---

Research for a solo hobbyist building a USB-PD modular-synth power supply in KiCad, driven by an LLM coding agent (Claude Code). Three approaches were already tried and rejected: letting the AI write `.kicad_sch` directly, schemdraw, and improving ASCII-art schematics. This page documents why those failed and what the field actually does instead.

## The Core Finding: LLMs Can't Do 2-D, So Stop Asking Them to Draw

All three rejected approaches failed for the **same root cause**, unfixable by better prompting: **LLMs cannot reliably encode geometry.** Tokenization flattens 2-D into 1-D and self-attention has no native 2-D inductive bias. The literature measures a **13–27 point gap** between an LLM's ability to *read* a spatial layout vs. *produce* one.

- **ASCII art** is unattainable by construction (a generation problem, not a prompt problem).
- **Raw `.kicad_sch`** is the *worst* possible target — explicit x/y/rotation, inverted Y-axis, 1.27 mm grid. The 2026 HWE-Bench benchmark for exactly this goal (spec → board schematic) has the **top model passing only 8.15%**.
- **schemdraw** is still a drawing API, so the layout burden stays on the human/model.

KiCad's lead developer Seth Hillbrand called natural-language circuit generation *"one of the least helpful applications for LLMs out there."* The whole field has converged on one architecture: **the LLM emits coordinate-free connectivity; a deterministic engine (or the human, in KiCad) does the placement.**

The real handoff is not "AI draws a schematic" — it is **"AI emits a structured, checkable connectivity artifact; you render it."**

```

*The LLM's job is to emit connectivity; geometry is always the deterministic engine's (or the human's) job.*

## Family 1 — AI Drives KiCad Directly (MCP / IPC / In-Editor Plugins): Dead End for Generation

- The official KiCad **9 and 10** API is **PCB-only**; KiCad 10 shipped (April 2026) still without an Eeschema (schematic) API. No sanctioned way to author a `.kicad_sch`.
- `kicad-sch-api` is the one library that can create wires/symbols from scratch, but its own issues admit "LLMs struggle with inverted Y-axis" and placement is "unreliable." An independent test called a Claude-generated KiCad schematic *"penguin on a bicycle level."*
- In-editor chat plugins exist (ALT TAB Circuit Copilot; KiC-AI with local Ollama; a community KiCad AI Assistant) — but they are Q&A/assist, not reliable generators.

**Useful subset:** read-only MCP servers for *interrogating* a design; `kicad-sch-api` for *scripted edits to schematics you already drew* (bulk rename, stamp a repeated block).

## Family 2 — Code-Defined Hardware That Exports to KiCad: Contains the Best Candidate

- **circuit-synth** (top pick) — Python (`@circuit`, `net += pin`) → a **real hierarchical `.kicad_sch` + `.kicad_pcb` + netlist, then stops before layout.** Mirrors the AI→schematic→manual-PCB split exactly; bidirectional, JLCPCB-aware, ships Claude Code slash-commands. Caveat: auto-*placement* is the weak link (topologically correct, not pretty); its ERC is incomplete and would not have caught the v3 STUSB4500 pin-18 bug.
- **SKiDL** — mature Python→netlist+ERC; its author says skip its schematic gen and go netlist→PCB. Best use: an ERC oracle for the repeated 78xx/79xx LDO stages.
- **atopile** — most mature, but produces **no readable schematic** (netlist/ratsnest only) — bypasses the step we care about.
- **Diode `pcb`/Zener** — best *verification* story (compiler + TestBench + SPICE, Anthropic-partnered) but exports `.kicad_pcb`, not `.kicad_sch`.
- **tscircuit** — architecturally right but React/TS stack mismatch.

## Family 3 — Better Text Representations + the Netlist Handoff: Lowest-Effort, Highest-ROI

<Note>
Hard fact: **KiCad has no netlist→schematic import.** A netlist gives a PCB ratsnest, not a drawn schematic. Auto-placement, not connectivity, is the unsolved part.
</Note>

**The winner: a net table + a Mermaid block diagram.** Drop ASCII *art*, keep a `| Net | Connected pins (Ref.Pin) | Value/Note |` table (one per sheet) plus a Mermaid `flowchart TD` for topology. Pure connectivity = zero geometry to get wrong = the LLM's most reliable output.

The repo's own `v3-pd-failure-diagnosis.md` proved this: a multi-agent pass produced false findings by *guessing pin numbers from screen position*, while the connectivity table made the analysis verifiable.

Optional docs upgrade: **lcapy** (1-D netlist + one direction word per part → clean rendered figure, guaranteed correct-to-netlist) — better than ASCII/schemdraw for figures, but needs a LaTeX toolchain and has no KiCad path.

## Family 4 — Commercial AI EDA: Mostly Not Composable with a Terminal Agent

Flux Copilot / Circuit Mind / CELUS are walled-garden chat UIs (replace the agent, don't compose). The AI autorouters (Quilter, DeepPCB) target the layout stage done by hand.

Worth adopting regardless: **Octopart** (free KiCad parts + queryable API) and **SnapMagic** (free native-KiCad footprint/symbol generation).

## Family 5 — Academic State of the Art: Steal the Patterns, Not the Tools

- A paper on **switched-mode power supply design with LLMs** (the exact domain): value/parameter tuning went **14% (GPT-4o alone) → 85% (o3 + SPICE) → 91% (o3 + RAG + SPICE)**, but topology adaptation stays ~50%. Lesson: **let the LLM size values for a topology *you* choose, in a SPICE loop; don't let it invent topology.**
- "Understanding" is now strong (96%+ netlist-from-schematic-image, even hand-drawn) → **sketch → digitize is a more reliable bet than generate-from-scratch.**
- EEschematic (MIT) is a runnable implementation of the "generate → render → critique" visual-chain-of-thought loop.

## Comparison of Top Candidates

| Tool | What it does | LLM-friendly? | KiCad path | Fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Net table + Mermaid | LLM emits connectivity + block diagram; you transcribe | High (no geometry) | Manual (the hinge to any generator) | #1 — adopt now, zero setup |
| circuit-synth | Python → real hierarchical `.kicad_sch`, stops before layout | High | Native `.kicad_sch` (best of any tool) | #2 — spike one sub-sheet |
| SKiDL | Python → netlist + ERC | High | Netlist→PCB only | #3 — ERC oracle for repeated stages |
| lcapy | 1-D netlist + direction hints → clean figure | Med-High | None (docs figures) | Docs-diagram upgrade |
| kicad-sch-api | Round-trip-safe `.kicad_sch` read/write | Med | Native | Scripted edits only, not from-scratch |
| Diode/Zener | Code + TestBench + SPICE | High | `.kicad_pcb` only | Verification experiment only |
| atopile | `.ato` → netlist/ratsnest | Med-High | No schematic | Poor fit (bypasses step 5→6) |

## Recommendations (A–D)

### A — Adopt Now (Zero Setup): Net Table + Mermaid, Replacing ASCII Art

Per circuit, emit a Mermaid `flowchart TD` (topology) + a markdown net table (one per hierarchical sheet). Bake the convention into CLAUDE.md. Transcribe into KiCad from a diffable, reviewable, geometry-free artifact. **Highest-ROI change.**

### B — One-Hour Spike: circuit-synth on the Linear-Regulation Sheet

Write it as circuit-synth Python, generate the `.kicad_sch`, and time placement tidy-up vs. hand-drawing ~27 parts. Keep it for well-understood sheets if it wins.

### C — Standing Safety Net: a Datasheet-Aware Review Pass Before Every JLCPCB Order

Export the schematic to compact text, feed it + datasheets to the LLM with a power-supply checklist (VBUS sense paths, EN/feedback dividers, dropout headroom, polarity, abs-max). A datasheet-aware pass plausibly *would* have caught "pin 18 → R14 → GND instead of sensing VBUS." Reviewer beats generator.

### D — High-Leverage: a SPICE Loop for Value-Sizing

The academic 14%→90% lever, runnable today in ngspice/LTspice, independent of any KiCad tool. For a noise-sensitive multi-rail supply this is arguably more valuable than circuit-synth.

<Note>
**Keep doing manually:** drawing the schematic + tweaking the PCB by hand, and choosing the topology. That is the correct 2026 division of labor, not a limitation.

**Bottom line:** the three rejections were all correct — only the *direct-generation corner* is a dead end. The realistic win is "AI produces a verifiable, geometry-free draft and reviews your work," not "AI replaces KiCad."
</Note>

## Corrections and Caveats

- The 13–27 point read-vs-generate gap is from the Schemato paper (arXiv 2411.13899); the HWE-Bench 8.15% figure is from arXiv 2603.18102. Both measure a specific task difficulty, not a permanent ceiling — models will improve.
- circuit-synth's auto-placement produces topologically correct schematics but the visual result usually needs manual tidying. Time savings depend heavily on circuit complexity.
- The SMPS-with-LLMs paper (arXiv 2507.10639) measured value-sizing accuracy on a specific benchmark; real-world SMPS design involves additional constraints not captured in the benchmark.
- lcapy requires a working LaTeX toolchain (TeX Live or MiKTeX) — non-trivial on some platforms.
- `kicad-sch-api` is the only library that can round-trip `.kicad_sch` files reliably; it is maintained by the circuit-synth team.

## Hands-on trial results (A–D)

These are the actual outcomes of running approaches A–D on this repo (wave-1 of the AI circuit design experiment, June 2026). Each subsection links to the artifact produced.

### A — Net Table + Mermaid Convention (adopted)

**What was tried:** Defined a repo-wide convention for documenting circuit connectivity using a net-connectivity table (one row per net) paired with a Mermaid `flowchart TD`, then applied it to the linear-regulation sheet as the first worked example.

**What worked:** The convention was baked into the root `CLAUDE.md` (§ Schematic Documentation Conventions) and a dedicated how-to page was created: [Net-Table + Mermaid Convention](../how-to/net-table-convention.md). The worked example covers all 27 parts of the three LDO stages, derived from a `kicad-cli` netlist export — no GUI, no geometry guessing. The table + Mermaid diagram accurately represent the linear-regulation sheet and are diffable in version control.

**What was blocked:** Nothing. Zero-setup, clean end-to-end.

**Verdict:** Adopted. Highest-ROI change of the four approaches. Replaces ASCII art as the canonical AI→human connectivity handoff.

### B — circuit-synth spike (not adopted)

**What was tried:** Installed `circuit-synth 0.12.1` on Python 3.14, modelled the linear-regulation sheet as a Python circuit description, generated a hierarchical `.kicad_sch` project, and validated it headlessly with `kicad-cli v10`.

**What worked:** Install succeeded on the first try (no compile, all wheels, ~1 min). `generate_kicad_project()` produced a valid hierarchical project (root sheet + three sub-sheets). `kicad-cli v10` parsed each sub-sheet cleanly (exit 0); it read the v9-era format token without error. Netlist/connectivity is correct — each 9-part stage has the right refs and nets.

**What was blocked / didn't work:** The generated schematics have **zero drawn wires**. Connectivity is expressed entirely through 22 hierarchical-label stubs per sheet. Auto-placement is a flat left-to-right row of symbols — no signal-flow layout, no GND rail grouping. All symbols are generic (`Regulator_Linear:*`, `Device:*`), not the repo's `zudo-pd:` library parts with real LCSC part numbers. The format token is v9, not the repo's v10. Result: converting the output to repo quality requires drawing all the wiring by hand, re-symboling every part, and re-laying the placement — roughly the same effort as hand-drawing (~2–3 h), plus the re-symbol overhead.

Full findings: `experiments/ai-circuit-design/circuit-synth-spike/FINDINGS.md`

**Verdict:** Not adopted for this repo. The pipeline works end-to-end and is useful as a netlist/connectivity generator or ERC cross-check, but for ~27 highly-repetitive LDO parts it provides no time saving over hand-drawing in Eeschema.

### C — Datasheet-aware schematic review skill (adopted)

**What was tried:** Ran a read-only netlist-topology review of the full `zudo-pd` schematic using `kicad-cli` export, parsed the 87-component netlist, and applied a power-supply checklist (VBUS sense paths, EN/feedback dividers, dropout headroom, polarity, abs-max). The workflow was then codified as a reusable `.claude/skills/pd-schematic-review/` skill.

**What worked:** The review confirmed the v3 fix is present: `VBUS_IN → R14 (470 Ω) → U1.18` with no GND on the pin-18 net (F-1). Feedback-divider math recomputed from the actual resistors matched the target rails to within 0.22 % (F-7). Load-switch polarity, VDD decoupling, CC Rd pull-downs, and VREG decaps all checked out.

**What was flagged:**

- Both the +12V (L7812, F-11) and −12V (CJ7912, F-13) LDOs run at only ~1.5 V dropout against a ~2 V typical spec — marginal at rated current. The [Linear Regulator (LDO) Stage](../overview/board-b-synth-power.md#linear-regulator-ldo-stage) section already flags this.
- Documentation discrepancy (F-9): `CLAUDE.md` and the architecture text describe the negative rail as "−15V (LM2586SX-ADJ inverted SEPIC)," but the actual schematic uses a third `LM2596S-ADJ` in an inverting buck-boost topology — a stale description that should be corrected.

Full findings: `experiments/ai-circuit-design/schematic-review/REVIEW-REPORT.md`

**Verdict:** Adopted as a standing safety net. A datasheet-aware net-topology pass would plausibly have caught the v3 pin-18→GND bug before ordering. The skill is now available to re-run before any future JLCPCB order.

### D — SPICE value-sizing loop (delivered, blocked on ngspice availability)

**What was tried:** Demonstrated the generate → simulate → read-back → adjust value-sizing loop on the LM2596-ADJ feedback divider (the +7.5 V intermediate rail, R3 = 5.1 kΩ / R4 = 1 kΩ). Two SPICE decks were written: a `.op` forward + loop-closed check, and an R3 sweep deck that prints the resulting rail voltage for a range of E24 values.

**What worked:** The algebra was verified and the worked result is documented. For the as-designed +7.5 V rail the divider gives 7.503 V (error +0.04 %). The re-targeting demo (13.5 V rail) shows the E24 pick: R3 = 10 kΩ → 13.53 V (+0.22 %). The decks are complete and ready to run.

**What was blocked:** No command-line `ngspice` was available on the host. The KiCad bundle ships ngspice as a shared library for GUI use only (`libngspice.0.dylib`); there is no `ngspice` CLI executable. A `brew install ngspice` attempt was killed by the 180 s guardrail timeout and was not retried. The hand-computed read-back values are exact and serve as the documented expected output.

Full findings: `experiments/ai-circuit-design/spice-value-sizing/FINDINGS.md`

**Verdict:** The workflow is sound and the deck is production-ready. Run `brew install ngspice` once to unlock it. Extending to ripple/regulation or dropout-headroom checks uses the same loop structure with a behavioural model or the LM2596 SPICE subckt.
