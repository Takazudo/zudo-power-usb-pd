description: How to document circuit connectivity using net tables derived from the KiCad netlist and Mermaid block diagrams.
---

## Overview

This page explains the repo convention for documenting circuit connectivity.
The preferred AI→human handoff artifact is a **net-connectivity table** (derived
from the KiCad netlist) paired with a **Mermaid block diagram** for stage-level
topology.

**Why not ASCII art?** LLMs are unreliable at 2-D spatial layout — a slight
misalignment makes a diagram misleading. Net tables are geometry-free (no 2-D
representation), generated from the authoritative netlist, and trivially
verifiable. Mermaid renders as a proper block diagram in the doc site. ASCII art
may still be used as an optional human-readable illustration, but it is not the
authoritative connectivity record.

## Net-Table Schema

One sub-table per hierarchical sheet. The three columns are:

| Net | Connected pins (Ref.Pin) | Value/Note |
|-----|--------------------------|------------|

- **Net** — the KiCad net name exactly as it appears in the exported netlist
  (e.g. `+15V`, `-13.5V`, `GND`, `Net-(U6-OUT)`). Cross-sheet nets keep their
  full path prefix (e.g. `/DC-DC Conversion/+13.5V OUT`).
- **Connected pins (Ref.Pin)** — space-separated list of `Ref.Pin` tokens for
  all pins on that net that belong to the sheet being documented (e.g.
  `U8.2 C16.1 C24.2`). Pins from other sheets may be omitted or listed as
  `<sheet>/Ref.Pin`.
- **Value/Note** — component value, net role, or signal description (e.g.
  `LDO input rail`, `470 µF bulk cap`, `+12V LDO output before polyfuse`).

## Generating the Table

**For `boards/board-a` and `boards/board-b`**, skip the netlist export entirely —
the net table is read directly off the spec module's `NETS` dict
(`scripts/schgen/board_a_spec.py` / `board_b_spec.py`), which **is** the source
of truth the `.kicad_sch` file is generated from. No KiCad install needed.

**For the legacy root project** (`zudo-pd.kicad_sch`), there is no spec module,
so derive the table from the **KiCad netlist** — never by eyeballing symbol
positions in the GUI. Export with (assumes `kicad-cli` is on `PATH`; on macOS
where KiCad wasn't added to `PATH` during install, the binary lives at
`/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/MacOS/kicad-cli`):

```sh
kicad-cli sch export netlist \
  --format kicadxml \
  --output __inbox/<sheet-name>-netlist.xml \
  zudo-pd.kicad_sch
```

The root schematic `zudo-pd.kicad_sch` contains all hierarchical sheets; one
export covers everything. Keep the raw XML in `__inbox/` (gitignored). Parse it
with Python's `xml.etree.ElementTree` — every `<net>` element lists `<node
ref="..." pin="..." />` children that map directly to the `Ref.Pin` column.

## Mermaid Block Diagram

Pair every net table with a `flowchart TD` that shows the stage-level signal
flow. Use one node per functional block; label edges with net names or voltage
levels:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  IN["+15V USB-PD input"] -->|"+15V"| DCDC1["DC-DC +13.5V"]
  IN -->|"+15V"| DCDC2["DC-DC +7.5V"]
  IN -->|"+15V"| DCDC3["DC-DC (inverting buck-boost) -13.5V"]
  DCDC1 -->|"+13.5V"| U6["U6 L7812\n+12V LDO"]
  DCDC2 -->|"+7.5V"| U7["U7 L7805\n+5V LDO"]
  DCDC3 -->|"-13.5V"| U8["U8 CJ7912\n-12V LDO"]
```

Keep the diagram at the **block level** — one node per functional stage, not
one node per component. Component-level detail lives in the net table.

## Worked Example: Board B — LDO + Protection Stage

Board B (`boards/board-b/board-b.kicad_sch`, generated from
`scripts/schgen/board_b_spec.py`) is a flat (non-hierarchical) schematic, so
there is one net table for the whole board. This example is a filtered slice
covering the LDO stage (U6 L7812CD2T +12V, U7 L7805ABD2T +5V, U8 CJ7912 −12V),
its bypass capacitors, indicator LEDs, polyfuse protection (PTC1–3), and TVS
clamping diodes (TVS1–3).

The table and diagram below are read directly off `board_b_spec.py`'s `NETS`
dict — no KiCad netlist export needed, per the "Generating the Table" section
above.

| `/DC-DC Conversion/-13.5V OUT` | `U8.2 C16.1 C24.2` (also `U4.3 U4.5 U4.6 D3.2 C9.2 C10.2 C11.2 R6.2`, `TP5.1`, omitted here) | LDO input for -12V rail; `U8.2` = VIN pin; `C16.1` = 470 nF, `C24.2` = 470 µF/35V |
| `Net-(U6-OUT)` | `U6.3 C17.2 C21.1 R7.1 PTC1.1` | +12V LDO output before polyfuse; `C17.2` = 100 nF output bypass, `C21.1` = 470 µF/35V, `R7.1` = LED resistor |

| `+12V rail` | `PTC1.2 TVS1.1` (also output connectors `J7.1 J7.2 J10.7 J10.8 J11.7 J11.8`, omitted here) | Protected +12V output; `PTC1.2` = polyfuse output, `TVS1.1` = TVS cathode clamp |
| `+5V rail` | `PTC2.2 TVS2.1` (also `J8.1 J8.2 J10.5 J10.6 J11.5 J11.6`, omitted here) | Protected +5V output; `PTC2.2` = polyfuse output, `TVS2.1` = TVS cathode clamp |

<Note>
Pin numbers follow the spec module's `COMPONENTS`/`NETS` tables, which match the
symbol pin numbers `gen_schematic.py` emits into the schematic — not necessarily
the physical package pin numbers. For example, `U6.1` is symbol pin 1 of U6
(L7812CD2T, TO-263-2 package), which is the IN pin.
