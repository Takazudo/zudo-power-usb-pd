title: Board B — Synth Power Conversion
sidebar_position: 21
description: Design doc for Board B of the 2-board split — the DC-DC, LDO, protection, and Eurorack output stages that carry the expensive parts, fed by a stable 15 V from Board A.
---

Board B is the **synth power conversion** half of the 2-board split (epic
[#86](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-pd/issues/86)). It receives a regulated
15 V from Board A (the USB-PD sink core) over a 6-pin cable and converts it into
the modular-synth rails: +12 V/1.2 A, −12 V/0.8 A, +5 V/0.5 A. Board B carries
every DC-DC converter, every linear regulator, all protection parts, and all
output connectors — in other words, essentially all of the board's dollar cost
and assembly complexity.

<Note>

Board B now has a real, generated KiCad project: `boards/board-b/board-b.kicad_sch`,
built by the `schgen` toolchain from `scripts/schgen/board_b_spec.py` — not hand-drawn.
The spec module is the source of truth; regenerate with `python3
scripts/schgen/gen_schematic.py board_b_spec` after editing it (see
`scripts/schgen/README.md`). PCB layout for Board B has not started yet (see epic #86
"Non-goals"). The stage-level net tables below are read directly from the spec module's
`NETS` table, which carries forward the DC-DC/LDO/protection/output connectivity from
the legacy, still-combined `zudo-pd.kicad_sch` (net names kept byte-identical to
`scripts/schgen/baselines/board-b.json` so `check_baseline.py` diffs cleanly) plus the
wave-6 locked decision deltas — part swaps, the `P1` ATT/PDOK provision, and the `TVS3`
orientation lock — see [Protection Stage](#protection-stage) and
[DC-DC Conversion Stage](#dc-dc-conversion-stage) below. The A↔B interface connector is
`J5` in the spec module (this page's connectivity tables use `J5`; the locked pinout
contract below keeps the generic "both boards" wording it was written with, since it is
byte-identical to the same block in the Board A doc).

</Note>

## Role in the 2-Board Split

| | Board A (USB-PD core) | **Board B (this doc)** |
|---|---|---|
| Carries | STUSB4500, USB-C receptacle, load switch, NVM programming pads | DC-DC converters, LDOs, protection, Eurorack + Faston outputs |
| Reusable elsewhere | Yes — generic "USB-PD 15 V sink module" | No — synth-specific rails and connectors |
| Component cost | Low (~$2.90, dominated by one $2.50 IC) | High (~$4.98 — see [Bill of Materials and Cost Split](#bill-of-materials-and-cost-split)) |
| Re-order cost when it fails | Small board, few Extended parts | Larger board, most of the design's Extended-part and hand-solder load |

This project has failed USB-PD negotiation on **four consecutive JLCPCB
orders** (v1–v4; see [current status](../inbox/current-status.md)), and every
failure traced back to the USB-PD front end, never to the DC-DC/LDO/protection
circuitry documented here. Splitting the boards means the next debug iteration
re-orders only the small, cheap board that actually keeps failing — see the
cost comparison below.

## Input: Board A ↔ Board B Interface Connector

<Warning>

The pinout table below is copied **exactly** from the locked spec in
[Board Split Decision](../inbox/board-split-decision.md) (#90, section
"Decision set (b)") and from sub-issue #92's own locked-spec block, so it is
byte-identical to the copy in the Board A doc
(`overview/board-a-usb-pd-core.md`). Do not edit the table's wording —
wave-4 (#95) diff-checks both copies against each other and against the
decision doc.

</Warning>

**Connector (both boards):** JST **B6B-XH-A(LF)(SN)** — 6-pin top-entry
shrouded THT header, 2.5 mm pitch, **LCSC C144397** (genuine JST; stock listed
2026-07-05, re-verify at order time). Rated 3 A/contact (AWG #22), 250 V.
**Cable:** commodity pre-crimped 6-way XH↔XH, AWG 22, 80–150 mm (or JST XHP-6
housings + SXH-001T-P0.6 contacts — verify stock at order time; cable-side
parts are not on the PCBA BOM).

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Notes |
|-----|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | +15V | A → B | Board A `VBUS_OUT` (post Q1 load switch), PD-contract 15 V |
| 2 | +15V | A → B | Paired with pin 1 (current sharing) |
| 3 | ATT | A → B, open-drain, active-low | STUSB4500 pin 11 (ATTACH). No pull-up on Board A; Board B (or any host) pulls up 10–100 kΩ to a local rail ≤5 V if used. May be left unconnected |
| 4 | PDOK | A → B, open-drain, active-low | STUSB4500 pin 20 (POWER_OK2): asserts when the PDO2 (15 V) contract is live. Same pull-up rule as ATT. May be left unconnected |
| 5 | GND | — | Paired return |
| 6 | GND | — | Paired return |

**Current-rating math:** worst case = PD contract cap **3.0 A @ 15 V**
(computed steady draw ≈2.5 A at the rated 26.5 W output budget). XH contact
nameplate 3.0 A; 80% continuous derate → 2.4 A/contact. 2 contacts per power
rail → 4.8 A derated capacity; at 3.0 A each contact carries 1.5 A = 50% of
nameplate → **1.6× derated margin (2.0× nameplate)**. GND identical (2
contacts, symmetric return). Cable drop ≈16 mV round trip at 3 A (2× AWG 22
per leg, 100 mm) — negligible.

**Keying/foolproofing:** the XH shrouded housing is mechanically polarized
(reversed insertion blocked). The 6-pin XH is the **only** 6-position XH on
either board — Board B's Eurorack outputs are 2×8 shrouded IDC and the Faston
tabs are physically incompatible, so the A↔B cable cannot land on a wrong
header. Pin 1 is silkscreened on both boards.

**Mechanical:** side-by-side, cable-linked (stacking rejected — see the
decision doc for the full rationale: USB-C enclosure access, Board A's NVM
pogo-pad access, Board B's TO-263 top-side airflow, and reuse). Each board
gets its own 4× M3 (3.2 mm) mounting holes; no shared hole pattern.

### How the connector feeds Board B's existing circuitry

In `boards/board-b/board-b.kicad_sch` (generated from `board_b_spec.py`), the interface
connector is `J5` and its pins map onto Board B's carried-forward nets like this:

| Connector pin(s) | Board B net | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2 (+15V) | `+15V -> +13.5V gen` | The shared bus feeding `U2.1 U3.1 U4.1` (see [DC-DC Conversion Stage](#dc-dc-conversion-stage)) |
| 5, 6 (GND) | `GND` | The system ground net |
| 3 (ATT), 4 (PDOK) | `ATT`, `PDOK` | Locked provision (decision `p1-form`,
`scripts/schgen/decisions.json`): routed to `P1`, a `PogoPad_1x04` bare-pad header (no
fitted component, out of BOM) — pin 1 = ATT, pin 2 = PDOK, pin 3 = GND probe return, pin
4 = declared no-connect. Board B is power-only and has no logic to consume these flags;
both signals are open-drain with **no on-board pull-up on either board** — any future
consumer wired to `P1` must supply its own pull-up to its own logic rail |

<Info>

The DC-DC input bus net is literally named `+15V -> +13.5V gen` in the
existing netlist — a leftover label from when U2 was the only thing on it (see
[Board B Architecture Review](../inbox/board-b-architecture-review.md) §2).
It already fans out to all three DC-DC converters, so Board B's layout simply
renames/re-derives this bus from the new connector instead of from the old
USB-PD sheet.

</Info>

## DC-DC Conversion Stage

Three LM2596S-ADJ (TO-263-5) converters, all fed from the shared +15 V input
bus: two non-inverting bucks (U2, U3) and one inverting buck-boost (U4). Net
connectivity below is from the current `dc-dc-conversion.kicad_sch` sheet,
unchanged by the split.

### Feedback dividers

| Converter | Rail | Top resistor (to output) | Bottom resistor (to GND) | Feedforward cap | Formula result |
|-----------|------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| U2 | +13.5V | R1 = 10k → FB | R2 = 1k, FB → GND | C31 (22nF) across R1 | `1.23 x (1 + 10k/1k) = 13.53V` |
| U3 | +7.5V | R3 = 5.1k → FB | R4 = 1k, FB → GND | C32 (22nF) across R3 | `1.23 x (1 + 5.1k/1k) = 7.503V` |
| U4 | −13.5V (inverting) | R6 = 1k, FB → −13.5V OUT | R5 = 10k, FB → GND | C33 (22nF) across R5 | `1.23 x (1 + 10k/1k) = 13.53V` (mirrored divider — see note below) |

All three recompute to their intended rail (formula per LM2596S-ADJ
datasheet, `Vout = 1.23 x (1 + Rtop/Rbottom)`, Vref = 1.23V). For U4, the IC's
own GND pin bootstraps to the negative output (see below), so the divider's
roles swap: the "bottom" resistor (R5, to system GND) and "top" resistor (R6,
to the negative output) give the mirrored formula
`|Vout| = 1.23 x (1 + R5/R6)`.

### Net tables

<Info title="Wave-6 part swaps on this stage's electrolytics">

Two locked decisions (`scripts/schgen/decisions.json`) change LCSC numbers on caps that
appear in the tables below, though the net names and pin roles are unchanged:

- **C5/C7** (decision (d)): swapped from the 100 µF/25 V ACMECON part to **FOLLON
  470 µF/35 V, LCSC C22387780** — the same line already fitted at C14/C20/C21/C24/C25.
  Restores positive input-cap voltage margin at both the 20 V mis-contract edge and the
  D5 clamp table point, and raises input bulk capacitance from 200 µF to 940 µF total.
- **C4/C22/C23** (decision (c)): canonical LCSC is **C335982** (ROQANG,
  `RVT1A471M0607`, 470 µF/10 V) — matches the drawn symbol and the `470uF 10V` Value
  label; `C22383803` (the number this project's docs previously carried) is a 16 V-rated
  alias part with far lower stock and is not what the spec module emits.

## Linear Regulator (LDO) Stage

Three L78xx-family LDOs clean up the DC-DC outputs for &lt;1mVp-p ripple.
Dropout margins below are from
[Board B Architecture Review](../inbox/board-b-architecture-review.md) (#89),
sourced against the L7812/L7805/CJ7912 datasheets.

| LDO | Rail | Intermediate → output | Available margin | Datasheet dropout (typ) | Actual load | Verdict |
|-----|------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------|
| U6 L7812 | +12V | 13.5V → 12V | 1.5V | 2.0V @ `IO = 1A` | **1.2A** | **Open item — see below** |
| U7 L7805 | +5V | 7.5V → 5V | 2.5V | 2.0V @ `IO = 1A` | 0.5A | OK — real dropout at half the test current expected well under 2.0V |
| U8 CJ7912 | −12V | −13.5V → −12V | 1.5V | 1.1V @ `Io = 1A` | 0.8A | OK, thinner margin than +5V — worth a bench check at full load |

<Warning title="L7812 dropout — open design item, deferred to the Board B design plan">

The datasheet's own typical dropout (2.0V, measured at 1A) already exceeds the
1.5V available on this board — and the actual load (1.2A) is *higher* than the
1A test point, where dropout is worse, not better. This is **not** resolved
here; per the #90 decision (disposition A5#1) it is explicitly deferred,
bench-gated:

- **Gate:** bench-measure a real L7812 at 1.2A from a 13.5V source before
  Board B's layout is frozen.
- **Preferred direction if confirmed:** raise the +13.5V intermediate rail
  (e.g. R1 10k → 11k gives 14.76V). This raises U6's dissipation from
  ~1.8W to ~3.3W, so the final setpoint is locked together with Board B's
  thermal budget (heatsinking, TO-263 copper pour), not before.
- **Fallback:** swap U6 for a lower-dropout regulator.

Do not silently "fix" this by picking a rail voltage in this doc — the numeric
setpoint is a Board B design-phase decision, not a documentation decision.

</Warning>

### Net tables (linear-regulation.kicad_sch)

| Net | Connected pins (Ref.Pin) | Value/Note |
|-----|--------------------------|------------|
| `/DC-DC Conversion/+13.5V OUT` (relevant) | `C14.1 C20.1 U6.1(IN)` | +12V LDO input |
| `Net-(U6-OUT)` | `U6.3(OUT) C17.2 C21.1 R7.1 PTC1.1` | +12V LDO output, before PTC1 |
| `/DC-DC Conversion/+7.5V OUT` (relevant) | `C15.1 C22.1 U7.1(IN)` | +5V LDO input |
| `Net-(U7-OUT)` | `U7.3(OUT) C18.1 C23.1 R8.1 PTC2.1` | +5V LDO output, before PTC2 |
| `/DC-DC Conversion/-13.5V OUT` (relevant) | `C16.1 C24.2 U8.2(VIN)` | −12V LDO input |
| `Net-(U8-OUT)` | `U8.3(OUT) C19.1 C25.2 R9.1 PTC3.1` | −12V LDO output, before PTC3 |
| `GND` (relevant) | `C14.2 C15.2 C17.1 C18.2 C20.2 C21.2 C22.2 C23.2 U6.4 U7.2 U8.1` | +12V/+5V decoupling references GND individually (see below for the −12V network's corrected form) |

<Info title="Negative-rail decoupling — fixed in #93, document the corrected network">

The as-designed −12V decoupling network (C16/C19/C24/C25) has a genuine
missing-GND defect: today's netlist still shows all four caps' far plates
tied to each other on an isolated node (`Net-(C16-Pad2)`), not to `GND` —
unlike the mirrored +12V/+5V networks, where the equivalent far plates connect
individually to `GND`. Per the #90 decision (A5#2), this is **fixed in #93**
by merging `Net-(C16-Pad2)` into `GND` (`C16.2`, `C24.1`, `C19.2`, `C25.1` all
become `GND` members). Board B's design should carry forward the **corrected**
network — i.e. C16.2/C24.1 and C19.2/C25.1 route straight to `GND`, matching
the +12V/+5V pattern — not the network as it appears in today's still-unfixed
netlist.

## Protection Stage

PTC resettable fuses plus TVS clamps on each output rail.

| Ref | Part (LCSC) | Hold current | Voltage rating | Rail | Rated load | Margin | Status |
|-----|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------|------------|--------|--------|
| PTC1 | [SMD1210P150TF/16](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/C7529589) (C7529589) | 1.50A hold / 3.00A trip | 16V | +12V | 1.2A | +4V nominal (+2.5V at the passthrough corner) | OK — wave-6 replacement, decision (g) |
| PTC2 | [mSMD110-33V](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/C70119) (C70119) | 1.10A hold | 33V | +5V | 0.5A | 2.2× | OK |
| PTC3 | [BSMD1206-150-16V](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/C883133) (C883133) | 1.50A hold | 16V | −12V | 0.8A | 1.875× | OK — 85°C-derated hold (0.77A) sits just under the 0.8A budget, NEEDS BENCH (finding BB-8) |
| TVS1 | [SMAJ15A](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/C571368) (C571368) | — | VRWM 15V, clamp 24.4V @ 1A | +12V | — | 25% standoff headroom | OK |
| TVS3 | SMAJ15A (C571368) | — | same as TVS1; **locked orientation**: cathode (pin 1) → GND, anode (pin 2) → −12V rail | −12V | — | 25% standoff headroom | OK — orientation locked by decision `tvs3-orientation` |
| TVS2 | [SMAJ6.5A](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/C87267) (C87267) | — | VRWM 6.5V, breakdown ≥7.22V, clamp 11.2V @ 35.7A | +5V | — | +1.5V standoff over nominal, +1.3V over the L7805's guaranteed 5.2V band top | OK — wave-6 replacement, decision (a) |

<Info title="PTC1 and TVS2 were replaced by the wave-6 decision lock">

Both rows above changed from earlier drafts of this page:

- **PTC1** was `SMD1210P200TF` (C20808) — a part whose primary-sourced `Vmax` is
  **6 VDC**, a deterministic BLOCKER on a +12V rail (finding BB-1, `fact-ptc1-vmax`).
  This is now replaced by `SMD1210P150TF/16` (C7529589, 16V) in the Board B spec.
- **TVS2** was `SD05` (C502527), `VRWM = 5V` — exactly the +5V rail's nominal voltage
  (0% standoff margin), and the L7805's own datasheet allows the output to reach 5.2V
  under normal operation, already above that standoff (finding BB-2). This is now
  replaced by `SMAJ6.5A` (C87267) in the Board B spec.

Both replacements are locked in `scripts/schgen/decisions.json` (decisions (a) and (g))
and land in `boards/board-b/board-b.kicad_sch` via `scripts/schgen/board_b_spec.py` —
not as a future "Board B design phase" item. The legacy `components/sd05.md` and
`components/ptc-12v.md` pages that once documented the removed SD05/SMD1210P200TF parts
were deleted in #136; the table rows above and their JLCPCB catalog links are now the
sole record of the removed-vs-fitted part history.

</Info>

### TVS polarity and connection rules

All three TVS positions use **unidirectional** parts, so orientation is functional, not
cosmetic. The cathode is the marked end — the color band denotes it
(`fact-smaj15a-polarity`).

| Position | Rail | Cathode (pin 1) | Anode (pin 2) |
|----------|------|-----------------|---------------|
| TVS1 | +12 V | +12 V rail | GND |
| TVS2 | +5 V | +5 V rail | GND |
| TVS3 | −12 V | **GND** | **−12 V rail** |

TVS3 is the reversed one, and that reversal is a **locked** spec point rather than a
layout preference: decision `tvs3-orientation` (`scripts/schgen/decisions.json`) requires
`board_b_spec.py` to carry it as explicit pin-to-net rows, which it does — `TVS3.1` on
`GND`, `TVS3.2` on `-12V rail`. Fitted the other way round, a unidirectional TVS on a
negative rail is forward-biased at −12 V: a dead short through one diode drop across the
rail, from the moment the board powers up. Nothing was *wrong* before this lock — the
orientation had simply never been captured by any spec artifact (finding BB-9), which is
precisely the state in which an assembly error goes unnoticed.

Correctly oriented, TVS3 stands off 15 V against the rail's 12.0 V nominal — 3 V / 25 %
margin (`fact-smaj15a-margin-plus12`, `fact-smaj15a-margin-percent`) — and its 16.7 V
breakdown minimum stays 4.1 V above 12.6 V, the band-edge proxy used for the CJ7912-fed
−12 V rail (`fact-l7812cd2t-vout-band`'s 12.6 V maximum, borrowed as the magnitude proxy
since no equivalent band is retained for the CJ7912).

### TVS placement and verification

A TVS only clamps what it sits next to: trace inductance between the transient and the
diode develops its own voltage, so a correctly chosen part placed far from the load still
lets the spike through.

1. Place each TVS as close to the protected load as the layout allows.
2. Short, wide traces — parasitic inductance of that path is the quantity being minimized.
3. Anode straight to the ground plane, with a short low-impedance return.
4. TVS goes **after** the PTC in the chain, matching the
   `Net-(U6-OUT) -> PTC1 -> +12V rail -> TVS1.1` ordering in `board_b_spec.py`.

No heatsinking is needed at any of the three positions. Steady-state dissipation is
≈75 µW (15 V × the 5 µA leakage maximum, `fact-smaj15a-leakage`) and lower still at the
12 V rail; the 400 W figure (`fact-smaj15a-pppm`) is peak **pulse** power on a 10/1000 µs
waveform, and the SMA package's own thermal mass covers events that brief. Repetitive
surges are a different question — consult the datasheet derating curves if the
application sees them.

Bench verification, per fitted part:

| Check | Expected |
|-------|----------|
| Reverse breakdown | ≥16.7 V (`fact-smaj15a-breakdown`: 16.7–18.5 V) |
| Leakage at the 15 V standoff point | ≤5 µA |
| Visual: cathode band orientation | Matches the table above — **decisive for TVS3** |
| Visual: solder joints, package integrity | No cold joints, no cracking |

Full clamping verification needs a surge generator and is out of scope for a bench
bring-up.

### Choosing a different SMAJ standoff

| Part | Standoff | Breakdown (min) | Clamp (VC) | Typical use |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| SMAJ12A | 12 V | 13.3 V | 19.9 V | Lower-voltage rails |
| **SMAJ15A** | **15 V** | **16.7 V** | **24.4 V** (at 16.4 A) | **±12 V rails — TVS1/TVS3 here** |
| SMAJ18A | 18 V | 20.0 V | 29.2 V | Higher-voltage rails |
| SMAJ24A | 24 V | 26.7 V | 38.9 V | 24 V systems |

Only the SMAJ15A row is primary-sourced in this project's evidence base
(`fact-smaj15a-standoff`, `fact-smaj15a-breakdown`, `fact-smaj15a-clamp`). The sibling
rows are family reference values and must be re-confirmed against the specific
manufacturer's datasheet before any of them is fitted.

Selection rule: **working voltage × 1.2, then take the next standoff up.** A 12 V rail
wants 14.4 V and lands on SMAJ15A; a 15 V rail wants 18 V and lands on SMAJ18A. Note that
the clamp voltage rises with the standoff, so take the *lowest* standoff that still clears
the rail's own upper band edge — every extra volt of standoff is an extra volt the
downstream parts must survive during a real event. TVS2's replacement (decision (a)) is
this rule applied on the +5 V rail: SD05's 5 V standoff sat exactly at the rail's nominal
and *below* the L7805's guaranteed 5.2 V band top, so it could conduct during normal
regulation.

### PTC1 and the L7812 current-limit cascade

The design intent worth recording is that **PTC1 is a backstop, not the primary limiter.**
The two protections work on different timescales: a linear regulator's current limit is
electronic and acts essentially at once, with thermal shutdown following as the die heats,
whereas a PTC is a thermal device that must warm for seconds before it trips. U6 therefore
reacts first, and in ordinary fault handling PTC1 rarely reaches its trip point at all. It
exists for the case where U6's own protection is bypassed or defeated — a shorted pass
element, or a fault that does not route through the regulator.

The PTC1 column below is sourced (`fact-ptc1b-ihold`, `fact-ptc1b-itrip`); the U6 column
deliberately states no threshold, for the reason in the warning that follows.

| Rail current | PTC1 state | U6's role |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 0–1.20 A (design budget) | Below hold | Normal regulation |
| 1.20–1.50 A | Still below the 1.50 A hold | Normal regulation; rail headroom being consumed |
| 1.50–3.00 A | Above hold, warming toward trip over seconds | U6's own limiting engages on a far shorter timescale, so it acts first |
| ≥3.00 A | Trips at the 3.00 A trip point | Rail stays off until the fault clears and PTC1 cools |

<Warning title="U6's own limit thresholds are not in this project's evidence base">

The L7812CD2T bundle (`.claude/skills/component-l7812cd2t-c13456`) retains **no**
current-limit figure and **no** thermal-shutdown temperature — only a `TJ` operating range
of 0–125 °C. Values such as "≈2.2 A current limit" and "150 °C thermal shutdown" have
circulated in this project's older component pages and are unsourced here. The *ordering*
in the cascade above is sound and is the reason the design works; the regulator-side
thresholds must come from DS0422 or a bench measurement before anyone designs against a
specific number.

</Warning>

### PTC1 voltage drop and acceptance testing

A PTC's series resistance shows up directly as output droop, so it is a budget item, not a
free protection layer. **The fitted part's resistance is not in the evidence base:**
`SMD1210P150TF/16` (C7529589) has confirmed hold, trip, and voltage figures but no
retained initial or post-trip resistance. The C20808 sibling's numbers (Ri min 0.015 Ω,
R1 max 0.07 Ω) belong to a different part and must not be substituted for it. The drop is
therefore a bench measurement, and this is the gate:

| Test | Procedure | Pass criterion |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Normal drop | Load +12 V at its 1.2 A budget; measure across PTC1 | ≤50 mV — a project budget (≈42 mΩ at 1.2 A), not a datasheet-derived expectation. Record the measured value |
| Overload trip | Load past the 3.00 A trip point, or short the rail downstream of PTC1 | PTC1 trips and output current collapses; record the time to trip |
| Reset | Remove the overload, let the part cool, re-measure | Rail returns and the normal-drop measurement repeats within tolerance |

Two numbers are worth tracking over the board's life, because PTC resistance rises with
trip cycles: the normal-operation drop (a growing drop is *the* wear indicator) and the
reset time after a trip. Separately, `fact-ptc1b-hold-85c` records that **no 85 °C-derated
hold figure is retained** for the `/16` variant, so hot-enclosure hold current is another
bench item — the same class of open question already flagged for PTC3 (finding BB-8).

### PTC1 failure modes

**Wear-out — the normal one.** After many trip cycles the initial resistance creeps up,
hold current drifts down, and trip time lengthens. The part still protects, at degraded
specs. It surfaces as a slower reset and a larger normal-operation voltage drop, which is
why that drop is the number to track.

**Stuck open — rare.** The +12 V rail goes dead with no backup on that rail. The symptom
is unambiguous (no +12 V at J7 or the Eurorack headers) and the fix is replacing PTC1.

**Stuck closed — rarer.** PTC1 stops protecting, but it is the outermost of four layers,
not the only one: U6's current limiting, U6's thermal shutdown, U2's LM2596S-ADJ current
limiting, and the USB-PD source's own protection all remain. This is the failure mode that
matters least — which is the same point the cascade above makes from the other direction.

### PTC2 hold-current rationale on the +5 V rail

PTC2 (mSMD110-33V, C70119) holds at **1.10 A** and trips at **2.20 A**
(`fact-ptc2-ihold`, `fact-ptc2-itrip`) on a rail budgeted at **0.5 A**, so the hold
current sits 1.1 A / 0.5 A = **2.2×** above the budget. The gap is deliberate:

- 0.5 A is the specified rail budget, so a 1.1 A hold leaves better than 2× headroom for
  power-on surge and brief spikes without nuisance trips.
- A sustained draw above 1.1 A trips PTC2 rather than pushing U7 or the +7.5 V DC-DC stage
  into their own limits — the PTC, not the regulator, sets the ceiling here.
- 33 V against a 5 V rail is 28 V of voltage margin (`fact-ptc2-vmax-margin`), so this
  position carries none of the voltage-rating exposure that made PTC1's original part a
  blocker.

<Note title="Why the 1.5 A target figure does not apply here">

Older writing frames this as "1.1 A hold for a 1.5 A target". 1.5 A is a capability of the
L78xx package family; it is neither this project's +5 V budget (0.5 A) nor a figure
retained in the L7805ABD2T bundle, which records `iout-rating` as 0.5 A. If a future
consumer genuinely needs more than 1.1 A sustained on +5 V, that is a rail-budget change —
re-derive the DC-DC stage, the LDO thermal budget, and the PTC together, not the PTC
alone.

</Note>

## Output Connectors

### J6–J9 — Faston rail terminals

| Ref | Net | Signal |
|-----|-----|--------|
| J6 | `-12V rail` | −12V |
| J7 | `+12V rail` | +12V |
| J8 | `+5V rail` | +5V |
| J9 | `GND` | GND |

Unambiguous 1:1 rail assignment — each Faston terminal's two tabs are tied to
the same net.

#### Mating connectors

The fitted part (TE `63951-1`, LCSC C591344) is a FASTON 250 tab — 6.35 mm × 0.8 mm
blade, right-angle THT (`fact-faston-tab-dimensions`) — so it mates with standard
FASTON 250 receptacles:

| Type | Wire size | Insulation | Typical source |
|------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Crimp receptacle | 18–22 AWG | Fully insulated | Electronics distributors |
| Quick-disconnect | 18–22 AWG | Partially insulated | Hardware stores |
| Wire-to-board cable | Pre-made | Various | Custom cable assemblies |

Prefer fully-insulated crimp receptacles on 18 AWG for the lowest resistance and the most
current capacity. Cable-side parts are not on the PCBA BOM.

<Caution>

`63951-1` is a bare tab on two THT solder legs with **no** mechanical retention feature —
no barb, no locking lance (`fact-faston-thru-hole-retention`; locking lances belong to the
separate FASTIN-FASTON housing family). Every insertion and extraction force at the
receptacle transmits straight into those solder joints, and no pull-out force is published
for the part. Treat repeated field mating as a solder-joint fatigue question and give the
pads generous copper.

</Caution>

#### Why a single GND terminal is enough

J9 is the only GND return for all three rails, which looks under-provisioned next to three
separate supply tabs. It is not:

1. In a Eurorack system every module's GND lands on the busboard anyway — the busboard
   already commons all of them, so a second board-side GND tab buys nothing electrically.
2. Worst-case combined return is the sum of the three rail budgets, 1.2 A + 0.8 A + 0.5 A
   = **2.5 A** — and that sum is itself conservative, since the ±12 V returns partly
   cancel in practice.
3. Fewer terminals means less wiring and fewer crimps to get wrong.
4. It matches how common Eurorack busboard designs are wired.

<Warning title="No verified per-part current rating for these tabs">

`fact-faston-current-rating-family` records **20 A**, but as a TE FASTON .250/.187/.110
*series* Performance Data figure that is not broken out per MPN — and its provenance is
`UNVERIFIED`, verdict `UNSOURCED`, because te.com could not be retrieved. The derived
per-tab margins (`fact-faston-j7-plus12v-margin` and siblings) inherit that status and are
all `NEEDS BENCH`. Headroom over 2.5 A is plainly generous, but do not quote a specific
terminal ampere rating in an order document or any safety claim until a primary source is
in hand. A 7 A figure appears in this project's older component pages; it has no source at
all.

</Warning>

### J10/J11 — 2×8 Eurorack power headers

| Pin(s) | Net | Note |
|--------|-----|------|
| 1–2 | `GATE rail` | Isolated stub — power-only board, nothing else on this net |
| 3–4 | `CV rail` | Isolated stub |
| 5–6 | `+5V rail` | |
| 7–8 | `+12V rail` | |
| 9–14 | `GND` | Six-pin GND "moat" separating +12V from −12V |
| 15–16 | `-12V rail` | Far end from CV/Gate/+5V — a one-pin connector misalignment lands on GND, never on +12V/−12V or a signal line |

This matches the community-standard Doepfer/Eurorack 16-pin power-header
convention. The exact physical key/polarization-slot orientation of the
`2541WR-2X08P` footprint (whether pin 1 truly sits under the red-stripe
cable convention) is not verifiable from the netlist — confirm against the
footprint silkscreen or a physical board before finalizing Board B's layout.

## Bill of Materials and Cost Split

Board B carries essentially all of the design's dollar cost and assembly
complexity. Figures below are the existing single-board
[BOM](./bom.md)'s per-stage subtotals, remapped onto the split.

### Component subtotal by board

| Board | Stages carried | Component subtotal | Source |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Board A | USB-PD (STUSB4500, load switch, USB-C receptacle, ESD/TVS, resistors/caps) | **~$2.90** | [BOM](./bom.md) Stage 1 |
| **Board B** | DC-DC ($2.24) + LDO ($0.64) + Protection ($0.82) + Output ($1.28) | **~$4.98** | [BOM](./bom.md) Stages 2–5 |

Both boards additionally carry one A↔B interface connector (JST B6B-XH-A,
LCSC C144397, a few cents each) — negligible next to the totals above.

### Why the expensive parts land on Board B

| Category | Parts | Unit price | Qty | Board |
|----------|-------|------------|-----|-------|
| USB-PD controller | U1 STUSB4500QTR | $2.50 | 1 | A |
| Power inductors, 100µH/4.5A | L1, L2, L3 | $0.378 | 3 | **B** |
| DC-DC converter ICs (TO-263-5) | U2, U3, U4 LM2596S-ADJ | $0.266 | 3 | **B** |
| Bulk electrolytics, 470µF (25V/35V) | C3, C11, C14, C20, C21, C24, C25 | $0.04 | 7 | **B** |
| Bulk electrolytics, 470µF (16V) | C4, C22, C23 | $0.05 | 3 | **B** |
| LDO regulators (TO-263-2 / TO-252) | U6 L7812, U7 L7805, U8 CJ7912 | $0.11 | 3 | **B** |
| Faston power terminals | J6–J9 | ~$0.26 | 4 | **B** |
| 2×8 Eurorack headers | J10, J11 | ~$0.08 | 2 | **B** |
| USB-C receptacle | J1 | $0.05 | 1 | A |
| Load-switch MOSFET | Q1 AO3401A | $0.02 | 1 | A |

U1 (STUSB4500) is Board A's single priciest part, but Board B still carries
**~1.7× Board A's total component cost** — and, more importantly for
manufacturing cost, nearly all of the design's physically large/hand-solder-
candidate parts (electrolytics up to 10.2mm tall, THT Faston tabs, THT 2×8
headers) and distinct Extended-part-fee line items (JLCPCB charges
**¥470 per unique Extended part number**, one-time — see
[BOM](./bom.md#jlcpcb-assembly-cost-structure)).

### Why split: debug-iteration cost comparison

This project has needed **four** re-orders so far (v1–v4), and every failure
has been in the USB-PD front end — never in the DC-DC/LDO/protection
circuitry this doc covers. Under the current single, combined board, every
one of those re-orders paid for the *entire* board:

| | Single combined board (current) | Split — Board A only re-ordered |
|---|---|---|
| Extended parts re-paid | ~20 unique Extended parts (~¥9,400 setup fee, per [BOM](./bom.md#jlcpcb-assembly-cost-structure)) | A handful — STUSB4500, USB-C receptacle, the shared A↔B connector (roughly 3–4 unique Extended parts) |
| Hand-solder / THT candidates re-paid | Faston terminals, 2×8 headers, tall electrolytics — none of which were the bug | None of these exist on Board A |
| PCB fabrication + stencil | Full-size board | Small board (front-end only) |
| Reference single-unit total (from [BOM](./bom.md#jlcpcb-assembly-cost-structure)) | **~¥16,500** for 1 board | Order-of-magnitude estimate: **~¥3,000–5,000** for 1 board, given roughly 3–4 of ~20 Extended parts and a much smaller PCB |

<Note>

The Board-A-only figure is an **illustrative, order-of-magnitude estimate**,
not a quote — Board A's actual layout, part count, and size are not finalized
yet (that is the next plan, per epic #86's "Non-goals"). The point the split
is designed to prove is qualitative and robust regardless of the exact
multiplier: a USB-PD-only debug iteration (the failure mode this project has
hit on every revision to date) no longer has to re-pay for inductors, LDOs,
electrolytics, and connectors that were never the problem.

## Design Notes from the #89 Architecture Review

Every finding from

| U4 inverting buck-boost referencing (GND/ON-OFF/TAB bootstrap, D3/L3 orientation) | OK-confirmed, no action | Carried forward unchanged |
| C5/C7 input-cap margin at the 20V edge case (20% headroom) | **Resolved — wave-6 decision (d)** — swapped to FOLLON 470µF/35V, LCSC C22387780 (same line as C14/C20/C21/C24/C25); margin now +2.6V at the D5 clamp table point and +15V at the 20V edge | Resolved — see [DC-DC Conversion Stage](#dc-dc-conversion-stage) |
| J10/J11 Eurorack header structure (GND moat, −12V placement) | OK-confirmed (structure); physical key orientation not netlist-verifiable | Carried forward — verify key orientation against the footprint/physical board before Board B layout is finalized |
