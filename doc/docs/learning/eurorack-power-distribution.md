# Eurorack Power Distribution Best Practices

Lessons learned from commercial Eurorack power systems, particularly the Toppobrillo Eurobus.

## Introduction

When designing a Eurorack power supply, the distribution system is just as important as the power regulation itself. This document explores best practices from commercial designs and their applicability to DIY/JLCPCB-compatible builds.

## Case Study: Toppobrillo Eurobus

The Toppobrillo Eurobus is a high-end Eurorack power distribution system that represents best-in-class design practices.

**Specifications:**
- Power: +12V @ 3.5A, -12V @ 2A, +5V @ 1.5A
- 20 keyed power connectors
- 4-layer PCB with stitched ground plane
- Zone-filtered distribution
- Soft-start and comprehensive protection

**Key Design Philosophy:**
> "By utilizing the full width of the busboard for thicker traces and uninterrupted ground planes, routing and return paths are optimized - reducing impedances, improving power delivery, and lowering noise across the board."

## Critical Design Features

### 1. Keyed Connectors (Critical Safety Feature)

**What:** Polarized/keyed 16-pin IDC connectors that physically prevent reverse insertion.

**Why important:**
- Eurorack modules can be **destroyed instantly** by reverse polarity
- +12V to GND short creates catastrophic failure
- Users work in cramped cases with poor visibility
- Ribbon cables are easy to connect backwards

**Standard vs Keyed:**

```
Standard 2x8 Header (No Keying):
  Can be inserted either way
  ❌ No protection against reverse connection
  ❌ User must check red stripe alignment
  ⚠️  Risk of module destruction

Keyed 2x8 Header:
  Physical key prevents backward insertion
  ✅ Impossible to connect backwards
  ✅ Foolproof connection
  ✅ Critical for beginners and low-light conditions
```

**Implementation Options:**

| Approach | PCB Side | Cable Side | JLCPCB Compatible | Safety Level |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Standard (our current)** | Standard pin header | Standard IDC | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Low (user dependent) |
| **Hybrid (recommended)** | Standard pin header | Keyed IDC connector | ✅ Yes | ✅ High (cable-side keying) |
| **Full keyed** | Keyed pin header | Keyed IDC connector | ❌ No | ✅✅ Highest |

**Recommendation for DIY builds:**
- Use standard pin header on PCB (JLCPCB compatible)
- **Strongly recommend keyed IDC connectors** on ribbon cables (user-sourced)
- Document the pinout clearly with pin 1 marked

**Where to source keyed connectors:**
- Tayda Electronics: 16-pin box headers
- Mouser/Digikey: Keyed IDC connectors
- Modular synth suppliers: Pre-made keyed cables

### 2. Zone Filtering Architecture

**What:** Multiple decoupled power distribution zones instead of a single point.

**Eurobus approach:**
```
Power Input
    │
    ├─→ Zone 1 (Connectors 1-10)
    │   ├─→ Bulk capacitor (470µF)
    │   ├─→ Ceramic decoupling (100nF × N)
    │   └─→ 10× Output connectors
    │
    └─→ Zone 2 (Connectors 11-20)
        ├─→ Bulk capacitor (470µF)
        ├─→ Ceramic decoupling (100nF × N)
        └─→ 10× Output connectors
```

**Benefits:**
- Isolates noise between module groups
- Reduces voltage sag from distant modules
- Lowers ground bounce and crosstalk
- Better current distribution

**Our current design:**
```
Power Input
    │
    └─→ Single output point
        ├─→ Bulk capacitor (470µF)
        ├─→ Ceramic decoupling (100nF)
        └─→ 1× Output connector
```

**When to implement zones:**
- Systems with >10 modules
- Multiple cases/busboards
- High-power digital modules (sampling, DSP)

**For single-output designs (like ours):**
- Zone filtering not necessary
- Good decoupling at regulator output is sufficient
- Keep output connector close to final filter caps

### 3. PCB Design for Low Impedance Distribution

**Eurobus best practices:**

#### 4-Layer PCB Stackup

```
Layer 1 (Top):     Signal traces, component pads
Layer 2 (Inner):   Ground plane (continuous)
Layer 3 (Inner):   Power planes (+12V, -12V, +5V)
Layer 4 (Bottom):  Ground plane, return paths
```

**Why 4 layers:**
- Continuous ground reference reduces impedance
- Power planes minimize voltage drop
- Better EMI/noise performance
- More routing flexibility

**2-layer alternative (cost-optimized):**
```
Layer 1 (Top):     Signal + power traces (thick copper)
Layer 2 (Bottom):  Ground plane + power traces
```

**Trade-offs:**
- 4-layer: Better performance, higher cost (~2-3× PCB cost)
- 2-layer: Adequate for small systems, lower cost

#### Copper Thickness

**Standard:** 1oz copper (35µm)
**Eurobus:** Extra-thick copper (2oz or more)

**Benefits of thick copper:**
- Lower resistance → less voltage drop
- Better current capacity
- Improved thermal dissipation

**Voltage drop calculation:**

```
Example: 10cm trace, 1.2A current

1oz copper (35µm), 1mm width:
  Resistance: ~17mΩ
  Voltage drop: 1.2A × 17mΩ = 20mV ⚠️

2oz copper (70µm), 2mm width:
  Resistance: ~4.3mΩ
  Voltage drop: 1.2A × 4.3mΩ = 5mV ✅
```

**Recommendation:**
- Power traces: 2oz copper, 2mm+ width
- Ground pour: Maximum copper area
- Signal traces: 1oz acceptable

#### Ground Plane Stitching

**What:** Multiple vias connecting top and bottom ground planes.

```
Bad (High Impedance):
  Top GND ═══════════════ Few vias
                          ↕ (long path)
  Bot GND ═══════════════

Good (Low Impedance):
  Top GND ═╪═╪═╪═╪═╪═╪═╪═ Many vias
           ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕  (short paths)
  Bot GND ═╪═╪═╪═╪═╪═╪═╪═
```

**Guidelines:**
- Via spacing: Every 5-10mm on ground areas
- Around high-current components: 2-3mm spacing
- Creates "stitched" ground plane with low impedance

### 4. Distributed Decoupling Strategy

**Eurobus approach:**
- Bulk electrolytic capacitors at each zone
- Multiple ceramic capacitors distributed along bus
- Low-ESR polycapacitors for high-frequency filtering

**Capacitor placement hierarchy:**

```
1. Regulator output (immediate):
   └─→ Large electrolytic (470µF) + ceramic (100nF)

2. Zone/distribution point (medium distance):
   └─→ Electrolytic (100-470µF) + ceramic (100nF)

3. Each connector (local):
   └─→ Small ceramic (10-100nF) very close to pin
```

**Why distributed:**
- Large electrolytics: Bulk energy storage, slow response
- Small ceramics: Fast transient response, low ESR
- Multiple locations: Reduces inductance from wire length

**Practical implementation:**

```
Poor (single-point decoupling):
  Regulator → [470µF] → 50cm trace → Connector
                                     ↑ Inductance kills fast response

Good (distributed decoupling):
  Regulator → [470µF][100nF] → 25cm → [100µF][10nF] → Connector
              ↑ Bulk              ↑ Local            ↑ Very close
```

### 5. Thermal Management

**Eurobus achievement:** 90% efficiency, runs "relatively cool"

**Heat sources in power supplies:**
1. DC-DC converters (switching losses)
2. Linear regulators (dropout voltage × current)
3. PTCs when tripped (self-heating)

**Thermal design checklist:**

✅ **Component spacing:**
- Keep heat-generating components apart
- LM7812 away from PTC fuses
- DC-DC converters in open area

✅ **PCB heat dissipation:**
- Large copper pours act as heatsinks
- Thermal vias under hot components (TO-263 packages)
- Multiple vias from thermal pad to ground plane

✅ **Airflow:**
- Don't block component top side
- Consider case ventilation
- Modular cases are usually well-ventilated

**Thermal via pattern example:**

```
TO-263 Package (top view):
  ┌─────────────┐
  │  [Thermal]  │ ← Large thermal pad
  │  [[[[]]]]]  │ ← 5-9 vias to bottom ground
  │  Pin Pin    │
  └─────────────┘

Bottom layer:
  Large copper pour connected via thermal vias
  Acts as heatsink (dissipates to case/air)
```

- ✅ Full JLCPCB compatibility (low cost, high availability)
- ✅ 4-layer protection (exceeds most commercial designs)
- ✅ PTC auto-reset (better than manual fuses)
- ✅ Low-noise architecture (DC-DC + linear)

**Areas for improvement:**
- ⚠️ Add keyed connector recommendation to documentation
- ⚠️ Specify 4-layer PCB in design files
- ⚠️ Specify 2oz copper for power traces
- ⚠️ Add thermal via guidelines

## Recommendations for Our Design

### Immediate (Documentation Updates)

**1. Update BOM connector section:**
```markdown
**Strongly recommended for cable assembly:**
Use keyed IDC connectors instead of standard ribbon cable connectors.
This prevents reverse insertion and protects modules from damage.

Sources:
- Tayda Electronics: 16-pin box header connectors
- Mouser/Digikey: Keyed IDC cable assemblies
```

**2. Add PCB design guidelines:**
- Recommend 4-layer PCB (or explain 2-layer trade-offs)
- Specify 2oz copper on power layers
- Thermal via pattern for TO-263 regulators
- Ground stitching recommendations

**3. Add assembly notes:**
- Mark Pin 1 clearly on silkscreen
- Add polarity warning labels
- Include Eurorack pinout diagram on PCB

### Future Enhancements (v2.0)

**If expanding to multiple outputs:**
1. Implement zone filtering (2 zones, 10 connectors each)
2. Add distributed decoupling at each zone
3. Consider larger current capacity (2A per rail)

**If moving to custom PCB manufacturer:**
1. Source keyed pin headers (not on JLCPCB)
2. Specify 2oz+ copper thickness
3. Add mounting holes for robust mechanical connection

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Keying is Critical for Safety
**Reverse polarity destroys modules instantly.** While not available on JLCPCB, strongly recommend keyed IDC connectors on cable side.

### 2. PCB Design Matters
**4-layer PCB with thick copper** significantly reduces noise and voltage drop. Worth the extra cost for >10 module systems.

### 3. Distributed Decoupling Works
**Multiple capacitor types at multiple locations** provides better transient response than single-point decoupling.

### 4. Our Design is Competitive
**4-layer protection + PTC auto-reset** exceeds many commercial designs. JLCPCB compatibility is a major advantage for DIY builders.

### 5. Thermal Management is Essential
**Component spacing, thermal vias, and copper pours** keep the supply cool and reliable. Don't neglect thermal design.
