### 🟡 Priority: Medium - Do Next

#### Step 3: Prepare PCB Design (Time: 2-3 hours) ← **We are here!**

**KiCad Project Setup**:

1. Create new KiCad project
2. Enter circuit in schematic editor
3. Add JLCPCB footprint library
4. Assign footprints to all parts

**Required footprints**:

- `/footprints/CH224D.png` - Already available
- `/footprints/USB-TYPE-C-009.png` - Already available
- Other standard footprints use KiCad standard library

#### Step 4: PCB Board Design (Time: 1-2 days)

**Layout Policy**:

1. **4-Layer Board Structure**:
   - Layer 1 (Top): Signals + component placement
   - Layer 2 (Inner): GND plane
   - Layer 3 (Inner): Power plane (+15V, +12V, etc.)
   - Layer 4 (Bottom): Signals

2. **Power Layout**:
   - Place USB-PD → DC-DC → LDO in sequence
   - Physically separate high-noise (DC-DC) and low-noise (LDO) sections
   - Make high-current paths thick and short

3. **Thermal Design**:
   - LM2596S (TO-263) → Place thermal vias
   - LM78xx/79xx (TO-220) → Reserve heatsink area
   - Consider electrolytic capacitor heat dissipation

4. **JLCPCB Design Rules**:
   - Minimum trace width: 6mil (0.15mm)
   - Minimum clearance: 6mil
   - Via diameter: 0.3mm (hole 0.2mm)

### 🟢 Priority: Low - Pre-Prototype Preparation

#### Step 5: Generate Manufacturing Files (Time: 1 hour)

- Generate Gerber files
- Generate Drill files
- Generate BOM file (JLCPCB format)
- Generate CPL file (component placement data)

#### Step 6: Get JLCPCB Quote (Time: 30 minutes)

**Quote contents**:

- PCB manufacturing: 5 or 10 boards
- SMT assembly: both sides or single side
- Parts procurement cost
- Shipping

**Estimated Cost** (for 10 boards):

- PCB manufacturing: ~$30
- SMT assembly: ~$50-100
- Parts cost: ~$50 (for 10 boards)
- Shipping: ~$20
- **Total: $150-200** (10 boards = $15-20 per board)

#### Step 7: Order Prototype (Time: 15 min order + 2 weeks manufacturing)

**Recommended Initial Order**:

- Quantity: 5-10 boards
- SMT assembly: All parts installed
- Delivery: DHL (2-3 weeks)

## 🤔 Design Concerns and Considerations

### Issues Resolved in Current Design

1. ✅ **Noise countermeasure**: DC-DC + LDO 2-stage design expected to achieve &lt;1mVp-p
2. ✅ **Beginner-friendly**: PTC auto-reset for automatic recovery from overload
3. ✅ **Cost**: Parts cost under $5 using many Basic Parts
4. ✅ **Procurement stability**: All parts have abundant JLCPCB stock

### Items Not Yet Verified (Confirm with Prototype)

1. ⚠️ **Thermal design**: Is LM2596S heat dissipation sufficient?
   - Maximum loss: Each 1.5V × 1A = 1.5W
   - TO-263 package should handle it but needs actual measurement

2. ⚠️ **Ripple noise**: Can actual measurement achieve &lt;1mVp-p?
   - Design should be fine but needs measurement

3. ⚠️ **Efficiency**: Can actual measurement achieve 75-80%?
   - LM2596S: 85-90%
   - LDO loss: 10-15%
   - Calculated overall efficiency: 75-80%

4. ⚠️ **EMI/EMC**: DC-DC switching noise impact?
   - Countermeasures with input/output filters but needs measurement

## 📝 Design Philosophy Review

### Why This Design?

1. **DC-DC + LDO 2-Stage Method**
   - Reason: Balance efficiency and noise
   - DC-DC only: Efficient but high ripple
   - LDO only: Low noise but poor efficiency (high heat)
   - **2-stage**: Best of both worlds ✨

2. **USB-C PD 15V Input**
   - Reason: Can use generic chargers
   - No AC adapter needed → Easy to carry
   - Any PD-compatible charger works
   - 15V voltage optimal for generating ±12V

3. **All Parts from JLCPCB**
   - Reason: Stable supply, low cost, automated assembly
   - Many Basic Parts → No extra fees
   - Abundant stock → Long-term procurement possible
   - SMT automated assembly → No hand soldering needed

4. **PTC Auto-Reset Protection**
   - Reason: Safe for beginners
   - Module overload → Notice when LED goes out
   - Auto-reset after 30 seconds → No repair needed
   - Fuse for short circuits → Safety ensured

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Final Goal

**"Manufacture beginner-friendly modular synth power supply with JLCPCB for under $20/board"**

### Achievement Criteria

- [ ] Ripple noise &lt;1mVp-p (measured)
