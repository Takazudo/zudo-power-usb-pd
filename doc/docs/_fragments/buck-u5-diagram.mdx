Note: For negative voltage regulation, all voltages are referenced to GND (0V).
      The buck converter operates with negative voltages, but the topology is identical.

      FB pin 2 connects to the tap point between R5 and R6.
      This tap voltage = VOUT × R6/(R5+R6) = -13.5V × 1kΩ/11kΩ = -1.23V
      However, the LM2596 measures this relative to its VIN (which is -15V).
      The FB pin sees: (-1.23V) - (-15V) = +13.77V above VIN, which gives ~1.23V regulation.

Connections:
  Input power:    -15V -> C9 (100uF) -> GND  (input filter, parallel)
                  -15V -> U5 pin 5 (VIN)
  Decoupling:     VIN -> C10 (100nF) -> GND  (high-freq decoupling, parallel)
  Enable:         ON pin 3 -> tied high (always enabled)

  Output stage:   VOUT (pin 4) -> L3 (100uH inductor) -> -13.5V Output
  Flyback diode:  Switching node (between pin 4 and L3) -> D3 (SS34 Schottky) -> GND
  Output filter:  Output -> C11 (470uF) -> GND  (parallel, NOT in series!)

  Voltage divider (sets output voltage):
                  Output -> R5 (10kΩ) -> Tap point -> R6 (1kΩ) -> GND
  Feedback:       FB pin 2 -> Tap point (junction between R5 and R6)
                  The divider creates a tap voltage for negative rail regulation

  Ground:         GND pin 1 -> System ground (shared with all components)
