## Previous Negative Voltage Designs

The following diagrams represent previous design iterations that have been replaced by the simpler, single-stage inverting buck-boost approach in Diagram4.

### [Outdated] Old Diagram4: +15V → -15V Flyback Converter (LM2586, U5)

**⚠️ This design was replaced due to:**

- **Critical feedback pin voltage violation**: FB pin would see -1.25V (violates -0.4V absolute maximum)
- **Overly complex**: Requires flyback transformer with specific polarity
- **Additional protection needed**: Missing switch clamp and snubber circuits
- **Not recommended by TI**: Datasheet examples use positive output regulation with cross-regulated negative outputs

### [Outdated] Old Diagram5: -15V → -13.5V Buck Converter (LM2596S-ADJ, U4)

**⚠️ This stage was eliminated because:**

- **Unnecessary intermediate stage**: Direct +15V → -13.5V conversion is possible in one stage
- **Lower efficiency**: Two-stage conversion (flyback + buck) wastes power
- **More components**: Additional inductor, diode, and capacitors
- **Replaced by**: Single-stage inverting buck-boost in new Diagram4

**Input Power:**

- `-15V input` → `U4 (LM2596S-ADJ) pin 1 (VIN)`
- `U4 pin 5 (ON/OFF)` → Left floating (internal pull-up enables regulator)
- `U4 pin 3 (GND)` → `System GND`

**Output Path (Buck Converter Topology):**

1. `U4 pin 2 (OUT)` → `L3 (100µH, 4.5A)` → Junction point
2. Junction point → `C11 (470µF/25V)` → `GND` (output filter capacitor)
3. Junction point → `-13.5V output` (to LM7912 linear regulator)

**Flyback Diode:**

- `D3 (SS34 Schottky)`:
  - Cathode → Junction between `OUT (pin 2)` and `L3`
  - Anode → `GND`

**Input Capacitors:**

- `C9 (100µF electrolytic)`: `-15V input` ⟷ `GND` (bulk input filter)
  - Polarity: Negative terminal to `-15V`, positive terminal to `GND`
- `C10 (100nF ceramic)`: `-15V input` ⟷ `GND` (high-frequency decoupling)

**Output Capacitor:**

- `C11 (470µF/25V electrolytic)`: Connected **in parallel** between `-13.5V output` ⟷ `GND`
  - Polarity: Negative terminal to `-13.5V`, positive terminal to `GND`
- Purpose: Output filtering, ripple reduction, and energy storage for transient response

**Feedback Network:**

- Voltage divider with compensation: `-13.5V output` → `R5 (10kΩ) || C12 (22nF)` → **Tap point** → `R6 (1kΩ)` → `GND`
- `C12 (22nF)` in parallel with `R5`: Feedback compensation (Type II), improves transient response and loop stability
- `U4 pin 4 (FB)` → Connected to **tap point** (junction between R5/C12 and R6)
- The tap point voltage = `-13.5V × R6/(R5+R6) = -13.5V × 1kΩ/11kΩ = -1.23V`
- Chip maintains FB pin at 1.23V below GND by adjusting duty cycle
- Output voltage formula: `VOUT = -1.23V × (1 + R5/R6) = -1.23V × (1 + 10kΩ/1kΩ) = -13.53V`

**Important Notes:**

- All voltages are negative and referenced to GND (0V)
- Electrolytic capacitors must have correct polarity (negative terminal to negative voltage)
- The buck converter topology is identical to positive voltage versions, just with negative voltages

## Obsolete Components Not Used in Current Design

The following components were planned for the old negative voltage generation design (LM2586 flyback converter) but were never manufactured. They have been replaced with a simpler LM2596S inverting buck-boost topology in the current Diagram4.

### Obsolete IC

- **U5 (LM2586SX-ADJ)**: Was planned for flyback converter topology
  - **JLCPCB Part**: [C181324](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/C181324)
  - **Reason for removal**: FB pin voltage violation issue (flyback topology forced FB pin below GND, violating -0.4V absolute maximum rating)
  - **Replaced with**: U4 (LM2596S-ADJ) in inverting buck-boost configuration (simpler, uses same IC as other DC-DC stages)

### Obsolete Transformer

- **T1 (MSD1514-473MED)**: Coupled transformer for flyback topology
  - **Specification**: 47µH:47µH (1:1 turns ratio)
  - **JLCPCB Part**: C40657138
  - **No longer needed**: Inverting buck-boost design uses only inductors, not transformers

### Obsolete Feedback Components

The LM2586 flyback design required different feedback component values than the standard LM2596S buck converters:

- **R7 (10kΩ)**: Feedback resistor (upper) for -15V output calculation
- **R8 (910Ω)**: Feedback resistor (lower) to set -15V output voltage
- **R9 (3kΩ)**: Compensation resistor for flyback stability
- **Replaced with**: Standard LM2596S feedback resistors R5 (10kΩ) and R6 (1kΩ), same values as U2/U3

**Current design benefits:**

- Simpler topology (single-stage conversion instead of two-stage)
- Uses standard LM2596S IC (same as other converters, reduces BOM complexity)
- No transformer required (just standard inductor)
- No FB pin voltage violations
- Fewer components overall
