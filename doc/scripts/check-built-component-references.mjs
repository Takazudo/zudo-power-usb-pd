/**
 * The built-output contract for the component-references section.
 *
 * Every check between the view model and these bytes belongs to the site
 * framework — MDX compiler, HTML minifier, search indexer — so the generator's
 * own tests cannot prove what a reader actually receives. This reads `dist/`.
 *
 * Forked from led-lamp's version. The part that must hold whatever the corpus
 * resolves is asserted for every record: exactly one section, before the
 * evidence tables, with all three cards, each either fully resolved or
 * explicitly unresolved WITH a stated reason. A card that is silently missing,
 * or unresolved with an empty reason, fails here.
 *
 * On top of that, the preview halves are asserted as SHAPE rather than as a
 * count: a record that resolves a footprint or a model must ship the island
 * markup and a real file in `dist/` for it, and a record that resolves neither
 * must ship no live preview UI at all. Both directions are checked because
 * this project's cards are independently optional — a future package
 * `easyeda2kicad` cannot supply a model for must publish, not fail.
