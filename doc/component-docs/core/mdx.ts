/**
 * Safe MDX generation: data to AST to text, then verify the text.
 *
 * Three layers, each of which alone would be insufficient:
 *
 *   1. BUILD  — the only way to construct content is the builders below, which
 *               accept `SafeText`/`SafeUrl` and a closed node vocabulary. There
 *               is no "raw" node type, so a caller cannot inject markup even by
 *               trying.
 *   2. SERIALIZE — `mdast-util-to-markdown` with the MDX and GFM-table
 *               extensions does the escaping. The MDX extension is what
 *               escapes `{` (plain markdown does not care about braces, so
 *               without it every evidence string is a live MDX expression).
 *   3. GUARD  — `assertMdxSafe` re-reads the FINAL file text and fails the
 *               build on anything active that survived. This is the layer that
 *               catches a serializer regression or a construct the extensions
 *               do not know about (`:::` directives are enabled on this site
 *               and are not part of any escaping table).
