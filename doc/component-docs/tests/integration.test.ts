/**
 * The cross-component rules: projection and page.
 *
 * Split from `projection.test.ts` and `render.test.ts` because the rules are a
 * separate dataset with separate hazards. Two of them dominate:
 *
 *   - a rule published without its refusal, its conditions or a calculation's
 *     conditions is the friendly implied PASS this whole feature exists to
 *     refuse, so each is asserted present rather than merely "the page renders";
 *   - a rule references records and facts it does not own, so every reference
 *     has to resolve to a real anchor on a real page — the case the generator
 *     fails closed on.
