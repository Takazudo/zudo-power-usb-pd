/**
 * Hand-authored sources that link into the generated component tree.
 *
 * `core/links.ts` proves the links the GENERATOR emits. It cannot see the other
 * direction, and there are now two of those:
 *
 *   - the BOM, the decisions log and the ratings matrix cite canonical record
 *     pages and fact anchors, and nothing in the generation pipeline reads them;
 *   - each owner bundle's `SKILL.md` carries a "Human component reference"
 *     section linking its own record pages. That closes the two-way path with
 *     the record pages' own link back to `/docs/claude-skills/<bundle>/`, and
 *     it is read from `.claude/` — a tree this feature otherwise only reads
 *     evidence JSON from.
 *
 * Both directions rot the same way. A record slug is a stable published route,
 * but a record ID rename in the evidence would leave these pointing at a page
 * that no longer exists — silently, since a browser does not report a missing
 * fragment and a 404 on an internal link is nobody's build failure. zfb's own
 * `linkValidation` cannot cover the fragments either: it resolves them against
 * heading-derived anchors only, so every `<EvidenceAnchor>` id is invisible to
 * it (see `core/links.ts`).
 *
 * So the check lives here, on the committed files, and fails the suite rather
 * than warning. Deliberately narrow: it validates `/docs/components/` targets
 * and nothing else, because that tree is the only one this feature owns.

  // ("zudo-pd does not yet generate per-record component pages..."). Neither
