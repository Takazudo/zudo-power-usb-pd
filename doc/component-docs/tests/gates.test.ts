/**
 * Correctness gates on the real corpus, where unsafe OMISSION is the failure
 * mode rather than unsafe disclosure.
 *
 * `corpus.test.ts` proves the counts and the relationships. This file proves
 * the things that would still be wrong with every count correct: an open
 * coverage domain that reads as safe, a denied field whose canary set has
 * quietly gone empty, a subordinate whose parent link stopped rendering.
 *
 * The hardest of these is the domain with no facts at all. 5 of zudo-pd's 57
 * open domains carry an empty `factIds` — they are open precisely because
 * nothing addresses them — so `reason` is the only content those sections
 * have. A page that renders them as a bare heading would show a component
 * with several silent gaps and read as complete.
