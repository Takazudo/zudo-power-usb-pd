description: Resolve the exact resistor, ceramic-capacitor, electrolytic-capacitor, and LED lines used across zudo-pd board-a and board-b (UNI-ROYAL 0603/0805 resistors, Samsung/Yageo MLCCs, ACMECON/HRK/DMBJ/FOLLON electrolytics, Hubei KENTO Elec 0603 LEDs). Use whenever one of the listed MPNs/LCSC IDs, a passive's electrical limit, voltage-rating-vs-rail margin, DNP/fitted placement, or the C4/C22/C23 470uF canonical-LCSC decision is relevant.

# Exact project passives

Run the central validator and read every local JSON record before using these records. Route an exact MPN or LCSC ID directly to its record; do not substitute a nearby value, a generic same-package part, or a same-name cross-vendor listing.

## Coverage

22 standalone records, one per inventory line, covering:

- **9 UNI-ROYAL resistors** (R0603/R0805): C25803 (100k), C23206 (56k), C23179 (470R), C23162 (4.7k), C23186 (5.1k), C21189 (0R jumper), C25804 (10k), C21190 (1k), C17513 (1k, R0805).
- **5 ceramic capacitors**: C13585 (10uF 1206, Samsung), C1711 (100nF 0805, Yageo), C15849 (1uF 0603, Samsung), C1623 (470nF 0603, Samsung), C1729 (22nF 0805, Samsung).
- **5 aluminum electrolytics**: C2983319 (470uF 25V, HRK), C22383803 (470uF, ACMECON -- see canonical-LCSC decision below), C22383804 (100uF 25V, ACMECON), C970687 (100uF 50V, DMBJ), C22387780 (470uF 35V, FOLLON).
- **3 LEDs** (0603): C2289 (yellow-green), C2288 (blue), C2286 (red).

## Evidence use

`sources.json` retains manufacturer datasheets (UNI-ROYAL resistor family sheet, Samsung/Yageo MLCC reference sheets, ACMECON/HRK/DMBJ/FOLLON electrolytic datasheets, Hubei KENTO Elec LED datasheets, all retrieved via LCSC's manufacturer-hosted `datasheet.lcsc.com` PDF host per the ss34-c8678 exemplar's precedent) plus this project's own netlist-derived `board-a-usb-pd-core.md` / `board-b-synth-power.md` design docs for topology and rail-margin facts. `facts.json` separates primary ratings, calculated RCWV/rail-margin/drive-current values, and project topology. Cite exact fact and source IDs with units, locators, and conditions.

Several vendor datasheets for the electrolytics/LEDs are vector-embedded PDFs that resisted clean text extraction; where that happened, the retained PDF is still hash-locked as the manufacturer-primary source, and its specification values are cross-verified against the corresponding LCSC product-detail page's structured (JSON-LD) Specifications data -- each such source's `evidence_extract` says so explicitly.

## Voltage-rating-vs-rail margins

Every electrolytic carries a `voltage-rating-vs-rail` (or equivalent) COVERED coverage entry with a CALCULATED margin fact, using the exact per-refdes net from `board-b-synth-power.md`'s netlist-derived tables where that is more precise than inventory.json's line-level function text (e.g. C22383803's C4/C22 sit on +7.5V while C23 sits on +5V; C22383804's C5/C7 sit on the +15V input bus, not a DC-DC output). **C970687 (C9) is the one exception**: per issue #117's explicit scope, its cross-rail bridging-voltage math (28.5V nominal / 33.5V edge case, from the LM2596S-ADJ inverting buck-boost topology) is owned by `component-lm2596s-adj`; this record carries only C970687's own 50V manufacturer rating.

**Open item**: `rec-c2983319`'s C11 placement has a documented conflict between inventory.json's function text (+13.5V DC-DC output) and `board-b-synth-power.md`'s U4 net table (which lists C11.2 on -13.5V OUT) -- not resolved in this pass; see `fact-c2983319-c11-net-discrepancy`.

## C4/C22/C23 canonical-LCSC decision

The schematic's placed symbol for C4/C22/C23 is `RVT1A471M0607_C335982` (Value `470uF 10V`), but each instance's `LCSC Part`/`Datasheet` properties point at C22383803 -- inventory.json (not edited by this bundle) therefore assigns C4/C22/C23 to C22383803/ACMECON. This bundle's `fact-c22383803-canonical-choice` picks **C335982 (ROQANG RVT1A471M0607, 10V) as canonical** for a future schgen-spec update, with **C22383803 (ACMECON RVT1C471M0607, 16V) recorded as the alias**, on dated (2026-08-14) evidence: C335982 shows ~368,560 units in stock at LCSC vs. ~3,790 for C22383803, and C335982's 10V rating matches the design intent and the drawn symbol/Value field, whereas C22383803 is actually 16V-rated -- correcting issue #117's assumption that both listings are 10V. This bundle documents the decision; it does not edit inventory.json or the schematic.

## LED polarity note

The green LED symbol (`YLED0603YG`, C2289) numbers its pins pin1=anode/pin2=cathode -- **reversed** relative to the blue (`Bluelight0603`, C2288) and red (`KT-0603R`, C2286) symbols, which both use pin1=cathode/pin2=anode. See `fact-c2289-polarity-note` and the LED2 pin-map lock; worth a physical/silkscreen check before assuming uniform LED2/LED3/LED4 orientation.
