description: Audit exact electronic-component identities and run the end-to-end workflow for adding or replacing a BOM part on board-a or board-b. Use whenever circuit, schematic, PCB, BOM, firmware, bring-up, substitution, replacement-candidate research, or related documentation could depend on a component rating, pin, package, source, or interaction.

# Component spec audit

Protect the design from plausible-looking but wrong component claims. Treat the generator specs as the placement identity lock and manufacturer documents as the authority for component behavior.

## Audit existing components

1. Run `python3 .claude/skills/component-spec-audit/scripts/validate.py` before relying on the registry, and read every `STAGED-SKIP:` line it prints. A staged PASS means the listed gates were not checked, not that they passed.
2. Resolve every relevant line through `references/inventory.json` by exact MPN, LCSC ID, manufacturer alias, function alias, board, or refdes. Load its `owner_skill` directly. Do not answer a subordinate-record query only from the parent component.
3. Read the owner skill's local `manifest.json`, `sources.json`, `facts.json`, `coverage.json`, `routing.json`, `interactions.json`, and `pin-map.json`. Apply the same standard to standalone and subordinate records.
4. Preserve the distinctions in [contract.md](references/contract.md): source authority and availability, fact class, provenance, conditions, derived dependencies, and verdict vocabulary.
5. DNP is per placement. Read the exact `placements[]` entry for the board and refdes in question; the same orderable is DNP at one refdes and fitted at another.
6. Cross-check claims against generated connectivity and symbol-to-footprint pin maps. For multi-component effects, also load the integration skill.
7. If an authoritative source cannot be retrieved or its retained extract does not support the claim, report `SOURCE UNAVAILABLE` and `UNSOURCED`; never reconstruct a fact from memory or a generic/same-name part.
8. Report exact fact IDs, source IDs, locators, conditions, calculations, and one allowed verdict. Keep design changes separate from the audit result.

## Staged and strict modes

`--staged` is the default while board-a and board-b are being built. It tolerates exactly two forms of incompleteness — an inventory owner whose skill directory does not exist yet, and absent `scripts/schgen/board_*_spec.py` generator specs (per board: a present board is checked in full while the absent board's placements are skipped with a printed note) — and prints every gate it skipped. It never relaxes a rule about data that is present. `--strict` restores generator identity parity, KiCad pin-asset parity, exact owner parity, and the non-empty pin-lock, critical-review, refresh-evidence, and cross-component-rule requirements.

## Replacement candidates

Research for a part that no board places is a candidate, not an inventory line. Record it in `references/candidates.json` and give it a record in its owner bundle whose `line_id` is null and whose `candidate_id` names the entry. A candidate never reuses a placed LCSC, so manifest-to-inventory parity stays exact while a replacement is still being decided.

## Add or replace a BOM component

This is the sole end-to-end owner for onboarding. Follow [the new-component
workflow](references/new-component-workflow.md) in order; do not create a separate
catalog-update or onboarding skill.

For a record-only update, copy `assets/component-skill-template/`, retain every
required file, and follow `references/schema.json`. Give subordinate records
independent IDs, sources, facts, locators, routing cases, and pin maps. Store
normalized short evidence extracts, not vendor PDFs. Put temporary downloads only in
ignored `tmp/pdfs/` and remove them after extraction.

Run the validator and unit tests after edits — in `--strict`, the same mode CI
enforces (a bare invocation runs the laxer staged mode and can pass where CI fails):

```sh
python3 .claude/skills/component-spec-audit/scripts/validate.py --strict
python3 -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/component-spec-audit/scripts -p 'test_*.py'
python3 .claude/skills/circuit-spec-integration/scripts/check_forward_tests.py --strict
```

Use `--online` only for an explicit source refresh; it fetches each source in memory, rejects stale hashes, retains nothing on disk, and does not alter retained evidence.
