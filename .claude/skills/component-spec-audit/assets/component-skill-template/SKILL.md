# Exact component record

Run the central validator, read every local JSON record, and cite fact/source IDs with
conditions and locators. Preserve `SOURCE UNAVAILABLE` and `UNSOURCED`; never replace
exact-orderable evidence with memory or same-name vendor data. Keep this owner aligned
with its `manifest.json`, `sources.json`, `facts.json`, `coverage.json`,
`routing.json`, `interactions.json`, and `pin-map.json`; its inventory line or
candidate entry, direct-routing fixture, real-pin lock, and any applicable
cross-component forward test.

A record for a placed part sets `line_id` and leaves `candidate_id` null. A record for
an unplaced replacement candidate does the opposite: `line_id` is null and
`candidate_id` names its entry in
`.claude/skills/component-spec-audit/references/candidates.json`.

## Human component reference

Human projection of this bundle: [rec-example](/docs/components/records/example/).
Replace this with one link for every owned record, then link the [component
catalog](/docs/components/catalog/) and [cross-component rules](/docs/components/integration/).
These pages are generated from this bundle's JSON files and add nothing to them.
