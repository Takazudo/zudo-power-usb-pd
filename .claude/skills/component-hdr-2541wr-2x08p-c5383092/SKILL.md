# HanElectricity 2541WR-2X08P (LCSC C5383092)

Run the central validator and read every local artifact. LCSC catalogs C5383092 as
manufacturer HanElectricity, model `2541WR-2x08P` (distributor renders lowercase x; the
project inventories uppercase `2541WR-2X08P` -- a formatting variance, not an identity
conflict), matching the v0.4.0 as-ordered BOM row for J10/J11. The manufacturer's own
engineering drawing is a **generic-family** drawing (part number literally `2541WR-2xXXP`)
covering the whole 2xNN position-count family, so every electrical rating pulled from it
(250V/3.0A AC/DC, -40 to +105 C) is a family-level figure, not confirmed specifically for
this 16-position/2x8 variant; no independently-reachable manufacturer-primary source was
checked beyond the LCSC-hosted drawing mirror, so every rating stays UNSOURCED.

Pin pairs (per board-b-synth-power.md, doc-level only): 1-2 GATE (isolated stub), 3-4 CV
(isolated stub), 5-6 +5V, 7-8 +12V, 9-14 GND (six-pin moat separating +12V from -12V),
15-16 -12V. This table is **not** promoted into the Ref.Pin-granularity
`scripts/schgen/baselines/board-b.json` baseline -- it explicitly lists GATE rail, CV
rail, and GND(output stage) as unresolved for J10/J11 because J10 vs J11 physical-pin
identity is not disambiguated in the source doc. The 2x8 shrouded key/polarization-slot
orientation (which physical pin is "pin 1") is a standing NEEDS BENCH checklist item --
not verifiable from the netlist or any KiCad asset, confirm against the footprint
silkscreen or a physical board before Board B layout is finalized.
